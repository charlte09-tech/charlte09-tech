    <h1>TikTok and the Attention Span of Today’s Generation</h1>
    <p>Exploring how fast-paced content shapes our focus.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In the recent years, TikTok has become one of the most
        influential platforms in shaping the way young people consume content.
        Unlike traditional media, where television shows, articles, or even YouTube videos
        demand a longer span of attention, TikTok’s short-form videos encourage users to
        swipe quickly from one video to another. The endless feed of clips has created a social environment where rapid consumption is the
        norm. In this proposal, we want to understand whether such habits may have long-term effects on our
        ability to focus and sustain attention on demanding tasks.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why is this topic important</h2>
      <p>
        Attention span does not only indicate the measure of how long someone can stay focused, it also significantly
        impacts learning abilities, productivity, creativity, and even emotional well-being. If our brains adapt
        to expecting fast-paced changes in content, it may reduce our patience
        in dealing with complex problems. On the other hand, short-form platforms could
        argue that TikTok motivates creativity by encouraging people to tell stories or convey
        messages in a limited time. The debate lies in whether this creative
        exercise outweighs the potential downsides of reduced focus.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Back it up with evidence</h2>
      <p>
        We propose to add images, graphs, and statistics
        to not only the content more engaging but also helps readers visualize the issue.
        	Infographics showing TikTok’s endless scrolling format, or interactive charts
        comparing attention spans across generations, can give readers a clearer picture.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pictures:</strong> Video recording of TikTok’s endless feed can highlight how quickly users consume content.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Visuals:</strong> Graphs comparing time spent on different platforms can show usage trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Citing studies adds credibility and helps audience to understand the scope of the issue.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps presenting two visuals side by side: one showing a TikTok feed full of
        fast-moving videos, and another showing a traditional news article or book chapter.

    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        TikTok is not inherently “bad,” but it is important for audince to understand the long-term effects on human behaviour. Ultimately, this discussion is about more than TikTok, it is about the
        future of attention in a digital age.
